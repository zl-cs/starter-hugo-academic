abstract: "Point   cloud   registration   (PCR)   can   significantlyextend  the  visual  field  and  enhance  the  point  density  on  distantobjects,  thereby  improving  driving  safety.  However,  it  is  verychallenging  for  vehicles  to  perform  online  registration  betweenlong-range  point  clouds.  In  this  paper,  we  propose  an  onlinelong-range  PCR  scheme  in  VANETs,  called  LoRaPCR,  wherevehicles achieve long-range registration through multi-hop short-range highly-accurate registrations. Given the NP-hardness of theproblem, a heuristic algorithm is developed to determine best reg-istration  paths  while  leveraging  the  reuse  of  registration  resultsto  reduce  computation  costs.  Moreover,  we  utilize  an  optimizeddynamic programming algorithm to determine the transmissionroutes  while  minimizing  the  communication  overhead.  Resultsof extensive simulations demonstrate that LoRaPCR can achievehigh  PCR  accuracy  with  low  relative  translation  and  rotationerrors  of  0.55  meters  and  1.43â—¦,  respectively,  at  a  distance  ofover 100 meters, and reduce the computation overhead by morethan  50%  compared  to  the  state-of-the-art  method."
